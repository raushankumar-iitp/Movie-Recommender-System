Movie Recommender System 🎬

This project is a content-based movie recommender system built using the TMDB dataset.
It recommends similar movies by analyzing key features like genres, keywords, cast, and overview.
The text data is processed and converted into vectors, and cosine similarity is used to measure how close two movies are.
The system allows users to select a movie and instantly get the top 5 best matches.
A Streamlit UI is used to make the recommendations interactive and user-friendly.
TMDB API is included to fetch movie posters, and the connection will be updated soon.
This project helped me understand vectorization, similarity scores, and real-world recommendation logic.
More improvements and deployment will be added in the upcoming updates.
